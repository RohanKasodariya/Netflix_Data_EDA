# Netflix Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a project focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset. The dataset includes information about various movies and TV shows available on Netflix, such as title, genre, release year, and ratings. This project aims to uncover insights and trends within the Netflix content library.

## 🗂 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the Netflix dataset to understand content trends, distribution of various genres, release patterns over the years, and more. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and insight generation using various data analysis techniques.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- **Show ID**: Unique identifier for each show.
- **Type**: Movie or TV Show.
- **Title**: Title of the content.
- **Director**: Director of the show or movie.
- **Cast**: Main cast involved.
- **Country**: Country of origin.

## 🧠 EDA Approach

The EDA process in this notebook includes:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing text data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing trends, distributions, and relationships using:
  - Bar charts and histograms for categorical data.
  - Line charts for time-series analysis.
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
- **Insight Generation**: Analyzing patterns in content addition, popularity of genres, and distribution of ratings.

## 🔍 Key Insights

Some of the key insights discovered through this EDA include:
- **Content Distribution**: Analysis of the number of movies and TV shows over the years.
- **Popular Genres**: Identification of the most common genres on Netflix.
- **Release Trends**: Observing trends in content releases across different years.
- **Country Analysis**: Understanding which countries contribute the most content to Netflix.
